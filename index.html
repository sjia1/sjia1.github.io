  <p align="left"> I am an Assistant Research Professor (non-tenure-track) at the <a target= _blank href="https://datasciencecenter.cornell.edu"> Center for Data Science for Enterprise and Society </a> (CDSES), Cornell University. I am interested in data-driven decision-making for business problems. 
More specifically, in terms of methodology, my research is focused on <em>online learning and optimization</em> -- an area that studies how to make informed decisions with a <em>stream</em> of data. In terms of applications,  I am interested in  marketing-related problems, such as advertising, pricing and recommendation.
